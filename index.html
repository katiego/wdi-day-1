    <p> Three interesting things I learned or questions I have from the reading I chose in part 3: <br>
1) Information is sent across the web, from one server to the client, in packets. Packets are parts of a file that range in 1000-1500 bytes. These are then read by the client to create the entire file. Not all packets take the same path to get to you. 
<br>
2) When the packets arrive to me, my computer arranges them according to the protocol (http) to put them together into the webpage / article / whole file
<br>
3) Without HTML, there would be no webpage! The client's browser interprets a webpage by first reading the HTML.
