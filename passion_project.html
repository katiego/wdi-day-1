    <p> My Passion Project : [working name] DynoPay
<br> I'm excited to work on an app/project that will allow companies that generate work via a queuing system to pay their workforce dynamically. This will be an Uber-like model that will pay workers based on demand (queue size/SLA/etc.). In higher queue times, where the company is at risk of missing SLA, the pay per task/hour will increase. As a result, workers will be incentivized jump in and get the queue down. Alternatively, when the queue is low, pay will decrease. 

<br>
Why might a company want to do this? Here are a few reasons: <br>
There is tons of loss $$ due to idle workers when the queue is low/empty. This would no longer be a problem with Dynopay. <br>
Some employees want to work more to earn more $$. Dynopay would provide this opportunity. There could also be a floor/base pay to ensure each employee makes a certain amount each week. 
<br>
Fewer missed SLAs! With Dynopay more tasks will be completed within goal. = more happy customers!
